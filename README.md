# neovim config

Initially forked from [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) (formerly tjdevries/kickstart.nvim); I moved to a separate repo to get rid of PR/rebase buttons showing on GitHub since this has diverged a ton

Requirements:

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- Some nerd font, probably


Installation example (macOS; post-requirements):


```bash
git clone https://github.com/collinmurch/nvim ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```
